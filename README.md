# Waveify
A python based app using the Spotify API wrapper spotipy to generate recommended songs based on your current playlists or given tracks. Work in Progress!

Disclaimer: I initally made this months ago so please don't judge the spaghetti code, I know its not great and I'm having a hell of a time updating it as is. 
I wrote it all inside one class so I could use attributes and used literally no object oriented principles in writing it and to be honest its too much work to update this to be object-oriented (as of now).

Also, as of now you need to supply your own client ID and client secret api keys. This can be done at [developer.spotify.com](url), but I promise I'll find a better way of doing this. You can put them into a .env file and they will work provided you use the names listed in the code. I know its not ideal.
